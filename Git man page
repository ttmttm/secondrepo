Eclipse - Exclude root directory from git repository?

answer is It is POSSIBLE with EGIT + M2E
trick is when doing share project -> in the configure git repo window
making sure use or create repository in parent folder of project is ticked
and making sure click create repository button
the main aim of this is to create the .git folder in you project root
not above your project root.
